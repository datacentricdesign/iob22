# Extra Task 6.1 Tweaking

Building upon what we cover, you can tweak the dashboard to your taste and check your understanding.

* **CSS and HTML** Here is a list of the CSS properties you can apply: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference)
* **Charts** Tune the charts by looking into the [Vega grammar](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/): colors, options, interactions. All these tweaking take place in the JSON template
* **Add more Countries** Update `/netherlands` to be able to choose the country, then call this new endpoint to display the distribution of several countries

Go ahead and share your dashboard on Discourse! Make sure to provide a title and a short description that capture what makes it YOUR algorithm.

# Extra Task 6.2 Developing Further

It is the end of the guided part for this assignment. Programming is all about practising, so we offer you a list of potential directions to explore this assignment further. In contrast with the previous assignments, these directions require more exploration.

* **Pick a new chart type** If you are interested in visualisation, you might want to pick from the Vega examples and add a new chart to your data dashboard such as the calendar or world map (see [Vega Examples](https://vega.github.io/vega/examples/)).
* **Process the data** If you are interested in Python and data processing, you might apply some operation on the data you receive from the API before visualising it. For example, you might calculate a moving average or use regression to estimate the trend in the coming days.
* **Design the User Interface** If you are interested in UI design, you might want to explore HTML/CSS/Javascript further to create, for example, a responsive side panel to select different pages or let the user select among multiple charts and tables.
* **Use a database** Use might want to store the data in SQLite to explore it with SQL queries.
