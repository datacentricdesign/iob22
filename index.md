# Welcome!

On this website you will find some resources to develop digital prototypes.

* [Computational Thinking]({{site.baseurl}}/computational-thinking/) is an introduction to programming in Python with an attempt to convey an approach to computational thinking. We use this material in 'Digital Product Development', a first-year Bachelor course at Industrial Design Engineering (TU Delft).

* [Data-Centric Design]({{site.baseurl}}/data-centric-design/) is a series of tutorials to get started with the digital tools we develop at the DCD Lab.

* [Practice]({{site.baseurl}}/theme-energy-transition/) is a set of tutorials we used in the past for teaching, which can provide additional practice.

* [Prototyping]({{site.baseurl}}/prototyping/) is a set of resources for Internet of Things prototyping, with a mix of Microcontroller and Python examples. It contains many links to the [folder of code examples](https://github.com/datacentricdesign/code/tree/main/examples).

All these resources are open-source. We encourage contribution (e.g. improvements, new tutorials) via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/datacentricdesign/code).
